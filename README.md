# SpoilSense
SpoilSense is an intelligent application designed to reduce food waste and promote healthy eating by leveraging the power of deep learning and image recognition. The system enables users to take a photo of any fruit or vegetable, and through a trained convolutional neural network (CNN), it accurately identifies the item and classifies it as either fresh or spoiled.

The core of SpoilSense lies in its deep learning model, which has been trained on a large dataset of fruit and vegetable images in various conditions. This allows the application to detect subtle visual cues—such as discoloration, texture changes, and mold—that indicate spoilage. With this capability, users no longer have to guess whether their produce is still good; they receive immediate, data-driven feedback.

But SpoilSense doesn’t stop at classification. If the item is deemed fresh, the system provides healthy and delicious recipe suggestions tailored to the specific ingredient. These recipes are curated to be easy to prepare, nutritious, and designed to encourage users to make the most of what they already have at home. Each recipe includes a health score, ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

The dual focus of SpoilSense—on reducing food waste and promoting wellness—makes it a valuable everyday tool. It empowers users to make smarter decisions in the kitchen, avoid unnecessary waste, and adopt healthier eating habits. It is especially helpful for people who often overlook produce in their fridge or struggle to come up with ideas for meals based on limited ingredients.

By integrating artificial intelligence with practical, user-friendly features, SpoilSense transforms the way we interact with food at home. It represents a step forward in using technology not just for convenience, but for sustainability and better living. Whether you're a busy professional, a home cook, or someone committed to reducing waste, SpoilSense offers a smart, responsible, and health-conscious solution
